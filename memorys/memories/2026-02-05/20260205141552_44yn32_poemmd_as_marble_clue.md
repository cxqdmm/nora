description: "User's 'marble' is likely hidden via poetic clue in /Users/mac/Documents/cxq/nora/workspace/poem.md; file is small (75B), unmodified, accessed recently; analysis focused on homophones ('xi'→'west'), imagery ('qing shi'→green stone jar), and physical context."

## 场景背景
The user's query 'I forgot where I put the marbles' led to discovery of a single file: /Users/mac/Documents/cxq/nora/workspace/poem.md. Its content is a 4-line classical poem:

山影静垂青，
溪声低绕石。
云来不惊鸟，
心远自无尘。

Analysis showed:
- No literal 'marble'/'ball' in filesystem → clue is linguistic or physical.
- File metadata: created & modified same time (2026-02-03), last accessed yesterday (2026-02-04) → actively consulted.
- Leading characters: 山溪云心 → 'Shan Xi Yun Xin'; 'Xi' (溪) sounds like 'West' → possible directional hint.
- Ending characters: 青石鸟尘 → 'Qing Shi Niao Chen'; 'Qing Shi' (green stone) evokes traditional marble storage (green stone jars); 'Chen' (dust) suggests 'dust-free' high location (e.g., top shelf).
- Most plausible resolution: marbles are physically near the computer/workspace, possibly in a green-tinted container, west-side of desk, or elevated/dust-free spot.

Next step: ask user if poem is self-written, and whether marbles are physical or digital.
